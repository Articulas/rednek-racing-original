# Red Neck Racing
Racing Game in Python based on "youtuber", sentdex's youtube tutorial.

This game is my creation after following this tutorial on https://pythonprogramming.net/pygame-python-3-part-1-intro/ .  
This game engine is a very basic and well used algorythim. The grapics files, and music files are the soul property of me Adam Hansen.
Make your own graphics, music files, game theme and name.

Otherwise you can use this algorythim for a few different video games.
Ok this will also be a guide to the updadted .py files. the regular 

redneckracing.py: file with no version information in the name is the first creation, simply a car, that moved to avoid objects, and keep score.
